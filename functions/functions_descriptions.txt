Description: Used for getting the ssa galaxies ready for galfitting.
Will contain recipes for extracting the galaxy from the relevant fits
file as a postage stamp, which contains the relevant header info for galfit,
and for rotating the file so that North is up to match the KMOS observations,
after this the rotated postage stamp will be saved with a different name.
Then for running sextractor on the object, not sure exactly how this will
work in an automated way given that there will definitely be some masking of
background contaminants required, and possibly a script for creating the
galfit input and running galfit.

Takes the segmentation map produced by sextractor, keeps the zeros the same
and sets everything to 1 that is not equal to the number of the object you are
attempting to fit
